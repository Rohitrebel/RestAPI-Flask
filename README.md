# REST API with Flask

This project is a simple REST API built using **Flask**, designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on in-memory person data. It is intended for learning purposes and API testing using tools like **Postman**.

---

## Features

- Add a new person using `POST`
- View all person records using `GET`
- View a specific person by index using `GET`
- Replace all data using `PUT`
- Update specific person data by index using `PUT`
- Delete specific person data by index using `DELETE`
- Delete all person data using `DELETE`
- Helpful response messages with proper status codes

## Requirements

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** and **Flask** installed.

Install Flask if not already:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a folder.

2. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open Postman or browser to test endpoints:
   - Server runs at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

---

## Example JSON for Testing

```json
{
  "name": "Rohit",
  "age": 21,
  "city": "Delhi"
}
```

---

## Testing with Postman

You can import these requests into Postman and test the API easily:

1. Launch Postman
2. Set method (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Use the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/<your_route>`
4. For `POST` and `PUT`, go to **Body → raw → JSON**
5. Paste the example JSON and click **Send**

## Notes

- This API **does not use a database**, so data resets every time the server restarts.
